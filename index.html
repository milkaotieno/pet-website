      <h2>Feeding</h2>

        <p>Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or
            canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions
            should
            not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.

            Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds).
            Please
            limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth
            problems
            and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and
            be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.

        <h2>Caring for the pet</h2>
        <img src="petimages/feed.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Properly caring for a dog begins with having the right perspective. Dog ownership should not be seen as a
            chore, but as an experience that enriches your life as well as that of your dog. Like humans, dogs need
            food, water, and shelter to survive. Yet, they also need physical care, mental stimulation, and nurturing to
            thrive. Providing these things is an essential part of keeping your dog healthy and safe and sets the
            foundation for a long, happy life with your dog.  
        
            <h3>What You Need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality dog food</li>
                <li>Crate, bed, or doghouse</li>
                <li>Time for exercise</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>What pets like</h2>
        <h4>#Walk</h4>
        <p>Dogs love the outside world. All the new smells and things to see and people to meet. Itâ€™s great. </p>
<br><br>
        <h5>#Treats</h5>
        <p>Because most dogs love to forage for treats, they should most definitely be considered a hobby.</p>
